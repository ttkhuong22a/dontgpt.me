  <h1>Let's Keep it Human</h1>

  <p>I'm noticing a trend where people reply to questions with screenshots of ChatGPT's responses. While I appreciate the thought, it often feels a bit impersonal.</p>

  <p>If someone reached out for advice or shared a personal struggle, chances are they're looking for a genuine human connection. They want to hear <em>your</em> unique perspective, experiences, or even just a kind word.</p>

  <p>ChatGPT is a powerful tool, and it has its place. But sometimes, a heartfelt response can mean so much more than a chatbot's analysis.</p>

  <p>Instead of automatically deferring to AI, perhaps we could approach online conversations with a bit more empathy and a willingness to connect on a human level.</p>

  <p>Let's make the internet a place for meaningful conversations, not just automated responses.</p>
